    "- A summary of the results:\n",
    "   - **Wins**: Teams that made it to the playoffs won, on average, around 20 games across the season, whereas teams that didn't make it only won around 12. Qualifying teams consistently won more games, whether home, away and within the conference than non-qualifying teams. As expected, teams have, on average, more Home Wins than Away Wins.\n",
    "   - **Losses**: Playoff teams average around 13 losses per season, with non-playoff teams losing about 21 games.\n",
    "   - **Rank**: Since playoff qualification is based on league rank, the playoff qualifying teams must be, and the metrics indeed show they are, ranked higher than non-qualifying ones. \n",
    "   - **Attendance**: The attendance for playoff teams is higher than that of non-playoff ones, around 14% percent higher more precisely."
