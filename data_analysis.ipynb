    "   - **Losses**: Playoff teams average around 13 losses per season, with non-playoff teams losing about 21 games.\n",
    "   - **Rank**: Since playoff qualification is based on league rank, the playoff qualifying teams must be, and the metrics indeed show they are, ranked higher than non-qualifying ones. \n",
