Qualifying teams consistently won more games, whether home, away and within the conference than non-qualifying teams. As expected, teams have, on average, more Home Wins than Away Wins.\n",

    "   - **Rank**: Since playoff qualification is based on league rank, the playoff qualifying teams must be, and the metrics indeed show they are, ranked higher than non-qualifying ones. \n",
